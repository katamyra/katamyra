### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Krish Katariya and I am a CS student @ Georgia Tech. 

I am interested in developing **full stack applications** and in applying **machine learning models** to real-world applications.

Currently, I'm learning how to develop full stack applications mostly by learning how to use Nextjs. I am also learning more of the theory behind most machine learning models. Here you can find some of my projects and class notes.
